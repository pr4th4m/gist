In this example,
we define a trait called MyTrait with an associated type called Item. 
The process method takes an argument of type Self::Item and returns the same type. 
The MyStruct struct implements MyTrait, and sets the associated type Item to be the same as the generic type T of the struct. 
The process method simply returns the argument it is given.
In the main function, we create an instance of MyStruct with an integer value of 42. 
We then call the process method on this instance with an argument of 10. 
The output shows that the process method returns the same value that was passed in.
So, to summarize, associated types allow you to define a type within a trait that will be determined by the implementing type. 
This provides a way to define generic methods that can work with multiple types, while still being type-safe.
